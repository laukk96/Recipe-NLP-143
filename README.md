# Natural Language Powered Recipe Parsing and Transformation

This is a NLP oriented parser that applies natural language oriented semantic/extraction methods to parse recipes from the [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/) website. We are able to extract (from the webpage) the ingredients, the steps, the primary, secondary methods and the tools used in the recipe.
